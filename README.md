# WordleLife

## Overview
WordleLife (Wordle + John Cena's [old catchphrase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOnuxjDML2s&pp=ygUJd29yZCBsaWZl)) is another Wordle-like game similar to Gamedle and Pok√©dle, but with a wrestling theme. After not finding anything of the sort, I decided to do it myself.

The basic idea is to try to guess a mystery wrestler based on hints around your own guesses. More detailed information about how to play is available on the website.

This project was built using Nuxt3, TailwindCSS and the NuxtUI component library.

- The database was built using slightly corrected information (two or three typos I spotted while skimming through the table) scraped from the [SmackDown Hotel website](https://www.thesmackdownhotel.com/wrestlers/). Apologies for any inaccuracies you might find while playing the game, but I have yet to proofread all of those rows.
